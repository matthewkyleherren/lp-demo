                    securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
                    Unfortunately, no system is 100% secure, and we cannot

                    may have data protection laws that are different from the
                    laws where you live. We endeavor to safeguard your
                    information consistent with the requirements of applicable
                    laws.

                    adequate level of protection under applicable data
                    protection laws, one of the safeguards we may use to support
                    such transfer is the

                    child, you may contact us as described in “Contact Us”
                    below. If we become aware that a child has provided us with
                    personal information in violation of applicable law, we will
                    delete any personal information we have collected, unless we
                    have a legal obligation to keep it.

                        on the Site and/or may also send other communications.
                        It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we

                        Reserving Your Le Prive. You agree to pay Samara a
                        deposit to reserve your Le Prive. By reserving a
                        Le Prive, you are offering to purchase a Le Prive.
                        Following receipt of your deposit, Samara will make an
                        assessment of your property based on the information
                        provided by you. If we determine that the installation
                        of the Le Prive is not feasible, we will refund your
                        deposit within [x] days from our notice to you. If your
                        property reasonably meets the requirements and criteria
                        for installation of the Le Prive, we will schedule a
                        visit to your property. If your property meets our
                        requirements and criteria after that visit, we will send
                        you a proposal which will include a Purchase Order and
                        Construction Contract which you will then need to sign
                        for the purchase and installation of your Le Prive. Any
                        such purchase is subject to approval of project
                        financing in addition to the terms of the Purchase Order
                        and Construction Contract.

                                Payments. When you reserve your Le Prive, you
                                expressly authorize us (or our third-party
                                payment processor) to charge you for the deposit
                                (a “Transaction”). We may ask you to supply
                                additional information relevant to your
                                Transaction, including your credit card number,

                        Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws
                        of the State of California, without regard to its
                        conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise
                        expressly set forth in Section 15 “Dispute Resolution,”
                        the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined
                        below) that you and Samara are not required to arbitrate
                        will be the state and federal courts located in the
                        County of San Francisco, and you and Samara each waive
                        any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.

                                Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. We each agree
                                that any dispute, claim or controversy arising
                                out of or relating to these Terms or the breach,

                                (collectively, “Disputes”) will be resolved
                                solely by binding, individual arbitration and

                                action or proceeding. You and Samara agree that
                                the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the

                                class action. This arbitration provision shall

                                The arbitration will be conducted by the

                                agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive
                                authority to decide all issues relating to the

                                governed by the AAA Rules, and we won’t seek to

                                we are responsible for paying, unless the
                                arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we

                                recover them from you. If you prevail in

                                Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. Except as
                                provided in Section 15(b) above, the arbitrator
                                shall determine all issues of liability on the
                                merits of any claim asserted by either party and
                                may award declaratory or injunctive relief only
                                in favor of the individual party seeking relief
                                and only to the extent necessary to provide
                                relief warranted by that party’s individual
                                claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a
                                claim and seek public injunctive relief (that
                                is, injunctive relief that has the primary
                                purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts
                                that threaten future injury to the public), the
                                entitlement to and extent of such relief must be
                                litigated in a civil court of competent
                                jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties
                                agree that litigation of any issues of public
                                injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the
                                outcome of the merits of any individual claims
                                in arbitration.

                                YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A

                                OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the
                                parties’ Dispute is resolved through
                                arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate
                                another person’s claims with your claims, and
                                may not otherwise preside over any form of a
                                representative or class proceeding. If this
                                specific provision is found to be unenforceable,
                                then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution
                                section shall be null and void.

                                (“Class Action Waiver”), if an arbitrator or
                                court of competent jurisdiction decides that any
                                part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable,
                                the other parts of these Terms will still apply.

                                Entire Agreement. These Terms constitute the
                                entire and exclusive understanding and agreement
                                between Samara and you regarding the Services,
                                and these Terms supersede and replace all prior
                                oral or written understandings or agreements
                                between Samara and you regarding the Services.
                                If any provision of these Terms is held invalid
                                or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court of
                                competent jurisdiction, that provision will be
                                enforced to the maximum extent permissible and
                                the other provisions of these Terms will remain
                                in full force and effect. Except where provided
                                by applicable law in your jurisdiction, you may
                                not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation
                                of law or otherwise, without Samara’s prior
                                written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or
                                transfer these Terms absent our consent or your
                                statutory right, without such consent, will be
                                null. Samara may freely assign or transfer these
                                Terms without restriction. Subject to the
                                foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to
                                the benefit of the parties, their successors and
                                permitted assigns.

                                Waiver of Rights. Samara’s failure to enforce
                                any right or provision of these Terms will not
                                be considered a waiver of such right or

                                provision will be effective only if in writing
                                and signed by a duly authorized representative
